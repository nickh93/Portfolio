        <p>My name is Niolas Hurtado, I am 23 years old and I am currently a student at
        Temple University's Fox School of Business majoring in Economics and Management
        Information Systems; and I am also enrolled in Epicodus' coding bootcam where
        I am looking to enhance my technical skills. I was introduced to programing in
        one of my classes at Fox and I found that I really liked it and that I had a talent
        for it which is what led me to enrolling in a course to learn much more abut it.
        I really like how powerful this is, and it is a very valuable skill in the current
        job market so I am hoping to get a lot out of this. I would like to work for a start-up
        company after finishing my course where I could learn much more about programming and
        put my new skills to test in a more practical form.</p>
